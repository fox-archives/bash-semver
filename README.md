# bash-semver

Semantic versioning for Bash

## Notes

Note that this library has a significant disadvantage (unlike my other Bash libraries) that it executes `perl` to parse the regex. This will be fixed in a later release

## Installation

Use [Basalt](https://github.com/hyperupcall/basalt), a Bash package manager, to add this project as a dependency

```sh
basalt add 'hyperupcall/bash-semver'
```
